# VisionPrep
VisionPrep helps creators generate smart, SEO-optimized ALT text and tags for images using AI. Upload up to 10 images and instantly get web-ready captions, keywords, and placement ideas.

## Upload limits

- Up to 10 images per batch (2 MB per file, 10 MB total).
- Recommended: aim for 10 images × ~1 MB each to keep requests fast.
- Replit and Netlify may enforce additional proxy limits—stay under their thresholds if deployments differ.
